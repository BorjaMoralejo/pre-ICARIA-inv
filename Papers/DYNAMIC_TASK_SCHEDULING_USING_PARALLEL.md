ever-increasing computational requirements [3]
 GAs to schedule tasks in homogeneous [8, 9] and heterogeneous [3, 6, 7] multi-processor systems --- mas info sobre genetic algorithms
Son costosos los genetics algorithms -- 1 CPU year has beenreported in the literature [10].

Task scheduling ia [3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14]
